<p>“A vibrant Arizona economic and natural resources future requires an integrated natural resources management strategy and implementing mechanism. Influencing federal decisions or contemplated actions with the potential to impact our State’s natural resources future is a cirtical component to that strategy. Consequently, State agency participation in federal processes must be consistent, proactive, and comprehensive. On January 14, 2013, the Honorable janice K. Brewer, Governor of Arizona, singed Executive Order 2013-12 establishing the Arizona Natural Resources Review Council (NRRC) for the purpose of addressing this essential need.”</p>

<p>-Interm Report of the Natural Resources Review Council, January 2014</p>

<p>This same Executive Order mandates that the NRRC build “a coordinated and centralized Geographic Information System database model that identifies current and future management priorities for designated land and natural resources” which should “provide full data integration across agencies.” This is the user-interface for the digital Decision Support System, which provides an enrty point and notification system for Arizona agencies in regards to natural resources federal alerts. This user-interface will also work with the centralized metadata catalog which integrates resources from Arizona agencies, providing a single voice and data display when responding to federal alerts or other actions.</p>

<p>The goal of the NRRC DSS is to 1) create a light-weight framework where Arizona agencies can efficiently funnel their metadata into a shared catalog, 2) develop a notification system for federal alerts, and 3) allow Arizona agencies to respond with a single voice in response to those federal alerts to protect Arizona’s natural resources.</p>

<p>The first track of development includes creation of the Natural Resources digital Decision Support System (Beta-Operational System) – which will include a digitization and integration of 9 Arizona agencies’ selected data and documents. This will demonstrate the way documents could be discovered/shared in the future. A catalog will be established, and repositories for those agencies in need, using free and open source software and with agreed-upon metadata standards established by the Council.</p>

<p>The first track includes construction of a map viewer which sits on top of the catalog for all 9 Council agencies upon final completion of the system – a complete alert system which is to mirror the Council’s “Functional Process Flowchart” – with RSS feeds and shared use comment site for inter-agency review.</p>

<p>As part of a parallel track of alerts workflow development (second track), this site also functions as the federal action notification and collaborative work space. It is a central document repository for state agencies to keep track of and coordinate natural resource federal actions (the policy side).</p>
