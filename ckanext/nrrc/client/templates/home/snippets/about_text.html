<p>“A vibrant Arizona economic and natural resources future requires an integrated natural resources management strategy and implementing mechanism. Influencing federal decisions or contemplated actions with the potential to impact our State’s natural resources future is a cirtical component to that strategy. Consequently, State agency participation in federal processes must be consistent, proactive, and comprehensive. On January 14, 2013, the Honorable janice K. Brewer, Governor of Arizona, singed Executive Order 2013-12 establishing the Arizona Natural Resources Review Council (NRRC) for the purpose of addressing this essential need.”</p>

<p>-Interm Report of the Natural Resources Review Council, January 2014</p>

<p>This same Executve Order mandates that the NRRC build “a coordinated and centralized Geographic Information System database model that identifies current and future management priorities for designated land and natural resources” which should “provide full data integration across agencies.” This is the user-interface for the digital Decision Support System, which provides an enrty point and notification system for Arizona agencies in regards to natural resources federal alerts. This user-interface will also work with the centralized metadata catalog which integrates resources from Arizona agencies, providing a single voice and data display when responding to federal alerts or other actions.</p>
